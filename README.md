# Verilog_basics
This contains basics of verilog codes

1. Implementation of I2C protocol using verilog :

a) Separate master and slave codes
b) Master can be implemented as set of tasks( write, read, multibyte write, multibyte read )
c) Slave can be FSM. Assume 128 byte R/W memory in slave.
d) Attached spreadsheet has I2C parameter specifications. Strictly use the same timing numbers in your codes.
e) Checker to check the correctness of read operation
